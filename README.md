## What is it?
It’s a software platform dedicated to the offer of cars and drivers. The name is an acronym for ride and drive.

## What is the problem?
Sometimes you need rent a car but often you have to go to the airport, or far away to pick it up, sometimes you don’t want to drive. Another example is that you need to go to multiple places but go on Uber it’s very expensive and kind a of waste of time because you need to wait for the driver to come.

## What’s my solution?
My solution is simple, we offer our platform for people who has a car, so you can rent it to somebody else per day. Or rent your car offering the service as driver.

## What’s my unique insight?
A difference between Uber/traditional car rents and us, is that for the client side, the guest can rent a car per day in an easier and simple way. for the host side, you can rent your car (make money while you sleep) or become a driver per day. So, you have a more organized day in the way that you know in mostly of the cases the time you will be working, once a guest buys your service you have a guaranteed payment. And you don’t have those intermediaries waitings that you have been an Uber Driver.

This is a personal project that went from scratch to what it is now. It all started with just a little bit of research, then making the wireframes, mockups, prototypes, coding and last but not least deployment. All the process and case study is on my [website](https://jesussandrea.com).
